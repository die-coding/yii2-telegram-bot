By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.

    Use this token to access the HTTP API:

]); ?>
```



Usage in controller
-----

First of all you need to disable the enableCsrfValidation feature in the controller

The robot is currently running from your server
But when we start /start run the robot from the telegram application on the mobile, the request does not reach the action inside the controller because the telegram sends the request to the POST and yii requests it without csrf
Sends Bad Request (# 400). So then the code doesn't run inside your method

Consider the following example
```php
class SiteController extends Controller
{
	public $enableCsrfValidation = false;

	public function actionIndex()
    {
        $res = Yii::$app->telegram->sendMessage([
            'chat_id' => $chat_id,
            'text' => 'hello world!!' 
        ]);
       
    }
}
```
